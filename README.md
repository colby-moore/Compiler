My awesome compiler

To try out my compiler, download the repo to desktop and open the compiler.html file.

For test cases:
Open up codeGenTestCases.txt and copy and paste test cases into the input text area and press compile, or go ahead and give the pre programmed test case buttons a click and press compile.
